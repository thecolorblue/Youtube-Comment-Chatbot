# Welcome to the Focus Locus Empathy Engine!

It looks like a normal chat UI but behind the scenes we have compiled your youtube comments into a character you can interact with. 

For this early version we have pulled back the curtain a little to show off how it works. Every message you send gets compared to all of the youtube comments from your channel. The most relevant comments are summarized and used to build a response to your message. You will see all of the related comments found in the dropdown below each chat response. 

## Things it can do:

Start with broad questions, like "what is your favorite video?". It will probably give you a generic answer but look for hints of details in its answer. Follow up with a "go into more detail about <X>", or "tell me more about <Y>.". You can then ask it about its sentiment on specific topics. 

It will sometimes have split feelings about a topic, which usually means your viewers do as well. It will not always have an answer for you and give you a very generic answer. This is a sign that there are not comments about that.
